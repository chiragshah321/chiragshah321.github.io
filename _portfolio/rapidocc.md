## Explanation

During my MBA program, I decided it was time for me to jump into entrepreneurship. At Babson College, the curriculum emphasizes starting with what you know. With that thought,
I knew one thing relatively well, the medical industry. I come from a family of physicians, and as a by-product, I overheard many complaints about the systems, processes,
and technologies they're forced to use throughout their work day. With this knowledge, I discovered an opportunity to introduce technology into the after-hours workflow of physicians.

## Problem

Through conducting 100+ customer interviews, what I discovered, along with my team, was that this workflow was very inefficient and costly. To paint a clearer picture. When
a patient calls after-hours, they're usually greeted by an operator. After a few words, the operator sends a text to the physician who is "on-call" that evening. The physician
then finds out more about the patient, then calls back. The problem is the the transmission of information is prone to error, and moreover, the lack of information in general
can be frustrating. Doctors have to log into their systems to check the patient's background or ask a lot of questions to the patient. Even worse is the fact that clinics must
pay a variable rate for each phone call, so the bill is unpredictable and can become exorbitant. 

## Solution

To solve this problem we created a SaaS solution that includes a web application and mobile application. When a patient calls now, all they do is leave a message and select urgency.
If non-urgent, we deposit it into our mobile app. If urgent, we send it to the physician. But, when we send it to the physician we communicate with the clinic's electronic
medical record company to provide the physician some additional details. Now, the physician gets the call with the patient's health information, along with their concern or question
in their own words. No errors, and more information. Lastly, we charged a flat fee for all of this, allowing clinics to control costs. 
 
## Results

After 18 months of work on this project, we've landed over 35 clinics across all specialities. We've partnered with 5 electronic medical record companies. We generate a mere $3K in 
MRR, which is a nice source of passive income. We're saving people money, while reducing headaches. Ah, the beauty of technology.


## Conclusion

Without this project, I likely would have never considered the tech industry as a career. But, due to the mere impact Rapidocc has, I am a converted technophile.
