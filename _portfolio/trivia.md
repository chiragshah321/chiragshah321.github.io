## Explanation

I love basketball, I also love my Amazon Alexa Tap. I though I'd marry the two by developing an application I could use to test my own knowledge and showcase to my friends. 

## Problem

I've never developed an Amazon Alexa Skill, and I had no idea how. Fortunately, the folks at Amazon have created multiple templates and tutorials for easy development. I used
the [Step-by-Step Guide to Build a Trivia Skill](Step-by-Step Guide to Build a Trivia Skill) to build my basic trivia application. Not exactly sure who the author is, but it's such an
in-depth tutorial, anyone with basic knowledge of programming can build their own skill in less than 2 hours. 

## Solution

One issue I had when testing was retrieving my skills logic. Fortunately, after tweaking the location of my server to N.Europe, I was able to successfully retreive my information. 
 
## Results

Building from this point on was a breeze. Just had to simply change the questions and answers in the index.js file and upload it to my lambda server. 


## Conclusion

In just 24 hours, I had built my skill and Amazon had approved it for public use. Thanks Amazon!
