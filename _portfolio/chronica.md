## Explanation

After building Rapidocc, I discovered another opportunity in the medical technology industry. This time, I was trying to make an even bigger splash. Hence,
I focused on patients with chronic conditions. While doing this, I discovered a great opportunity to create a platform for self-management of a program introduced
by changes in federal policy. This program, [Chronic Care Management](https://www.cms.gov/Outreach-and-Education/Medicare-Learning-Network-MLN/MLNProducts/Downloads/ChronicCareManagement.pdf), 
was created to properly manage patient populations with 2 or more chronic conditions. These patients tend to be at-risk and need extra attention to ensure they
continue to live happily and peacefully. Otherwise, they end up in the clinic or hospital, creating more pain for themselves and the entire industry as a whole. 

## Problem

The platform was created to address the need for a way to manage these patient populations internally, rather than through an out-sourced call center. Clinics
wanted to use their own resources for program operation as it required constant communication with their own patients. But, due to a lack of technology, and also
the quick introduction of the policy, the only option to partake in the program was to outsource. This route was expensive and unsupervised. Meaning that, 
clinics would ask call centers to conduct the program, who had little to no affiliation with the clinic. This caused worry and concern, and many clinics never adopted the program.
Hence, I felt that creating a solution would be helpful in this case. 

## Solution

The platform I created, Chronica, included the ability to enroll, manage, and bill patients with chronic conditions. It is a all-in-one solution that allows
practices to conduct the program by optimizing their current resources. As a benefit, they can communicate with their patients, and provide proper care. 
 
## Results

Unfortunately, the business failed before it started. Due to unforeseen circumstances, I have yet to sell a broader market, and do not intend to. Fortunately, I had pre-sold 
to a few practices, and have implemented into those client sites. But, I do not expect to continue working on this actively. I completed it primarily for them and their patients,
and I am sure it will serve them well. 


## Conclusion

Though this never grew into a massive operation. It taught me how to persevere and deliver if with significant adversity.
