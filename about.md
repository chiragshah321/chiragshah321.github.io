I'm a young dude just trying to make meaning in this wild world. Before I get into my professional life, I want to let you know who I am on a deeper level. 
I can't classify myself as anything in particular, but I'll try to give you a definition of who I am. 

**A Life of Virtue**

My mentors in life, excluding my father, are a variety of practical philosophers. I follow the economic philosophy of Ludwig Von Mises and Muray Rothbard of the Austrian School of Economic Thought.
I prescribe to the life philosophy of Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus. I attempt to acquire presence and ease of mind by meditation, where there are various teachers. I like to consider
myself in balance with the Eastern and Western philosophies of time. 

**A Life of Contribution**

Sure, philosophizing is exhilirating, but actually doing something with wisdom is why we even discuss such esoteric subjects. I like to spend most of my time building, learning, or contributing. 
By building, I mean medical technology companies. By learning, I mean reading, listening, or discussing topics such as web development, global culture and artifacts, entrepreneurship, and almost everthing in between. 
And by contributing, I mean helping via mentoring or connecting. 

**Few Professional Accomplishments**

Co-founder of [Rapidocc](https://www.rapidocc.com). A medical SaaS that streamlines the after-hours care process. To date, it serves over 30 practices and continues to grow, albeit passively.
I started the company during my MBA progam at [Babson College](http://www.babson.edu/Pages/default.aspx). It solved two inherent problems with the medical industry - point of contact information,
and documentation of after-hours calls. Led product development efforts with my co-founder, Ashok Vairavan.

Built [Chronica](www.chronicacare.com). Though I didn't take this too far, I led the product development effort for Chronica, a care coordination application for the medical industry. 
The goal of Chronica is to in-source care for patients with two or more chronic conditions. 

I've also worked at [Bridgeway Capital](https://www.bridgewaycapital.org/) as a Credit Analyst, and also [Vanguard](https://investor.vanguard.com/corporate-portal/) as a Portfolio Specialist.

In addition to my short professional career, I've spent a lot of time volunteering with organizations. Specifically, I've been a basketball coach, mentee, and economics teacher to 
at-risk youth.
