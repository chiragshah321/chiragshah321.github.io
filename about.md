I'm a young dude just trying to make meaning in this wild world. I can't classify myself as anything in particular, but I'll try to give you a definition of who I am. 

** A Life of Virtue **

My mentors in life, excluding my father, are a variety of practical philosophers. I follow the economic philosophy of Ludwig Von Mises and Muray Rothbard of the Austrian School of Economic Thought.
I prescribe to the life philosophy of Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus. I attempt to acquire presence and ease of mind by meditation, where there are various teachers. I like to consider
myself in balance with the Eastern and Western philosophies of time. 

** A Life of Contribution **

Sure, philosophizing is exhilirating, but actually doing something with wisdom is why we even discuss such esoteric subjects. I like to spend most of my time building, learning, or contributing. 
By building, I mean companies. By learning, I mean reading, listening, or discussing. And by contributing, I mean helping. 

** All The Other Stuff **

I don't want to stay on the heavy stuff, so I'll end now. I'm a simple dude, just trying to become the best being I can be. I'm always available to chat or help, so just give me a holler.
