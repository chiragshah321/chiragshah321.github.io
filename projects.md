I'm a young dude just trying to make meaning in this wild world. I can't classify myself as anything in particular, but I'll try to give you a definition of who I am. 

**A Life of Virtue**

My mentors in life, excluding my father, are a variety of practical philosophers. I follow the economic philosophy of Ludwig Von Mises and Muray Rothbard of the Austrian School of Economic Thought.
I prescribe to the life philosophy of Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus. I attempt to acquire presence and ease of mind by meditation, where there are various teachers. I like to consider
myself in balance with the Eastern and Western philosophies of time. 

**A Life of Contribution**

Sure, philosophizing is exhilirating, but actually doing something with wisdom is why we even discuss such esoteric subjects. I like to spend most of my time building, learning, or contributing. 
By building, I mean medical technology companies. By learning, I mean reading, listening, or discussing topics such as web development, global culture and artifacts, entrepreneurship, and almost everthing in between. 
And by contributing, I mean helping via mentoring or connecting. 

**All The Other Stuff**

I'm a simple dude, just trying to become the best human I can be. I make mistakes, I learn from them to become more refined. I hope if I make enough I'll help you make
some yourself.

I'm always available to chat or help, so just give me a holler.
