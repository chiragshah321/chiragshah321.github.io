title: Why Am I Coding?
---
Speaking code is tough. Especially when your financial livelihood depends on it. That's why I started web development, because I want to communicate with people on my founding team intelligently to get stuff done. Knowing what they're doing, how they're doing it, and why they're doing it that way is critical when you've founded a small tech company. 

My company Rapidocc, uses a web and mobile app to improve after-hours care for patients and providers. I started it with my co-founder in January '16. Fortunately, my co-founder is a patient CTO who understood my tech incompetence. But, I'm not the type of guy who enjoys being frustrated by his own product due to lack of basic development knowledge. So once our company started generating revenue and I saw a real future in tech for myself, and I began to entertain the idea of becoming a competent web developer. 

And now here I am, trying to learn day by day. In addition to becoming a more respectable professional in the burgeoning field of medical technology, web development also empowers medical to build other types of web applications for people who need it. Being a person who tries to make an impact every day, I've always been searching for the field of industry that does that almost all the time. And as I get deeper into the world of web development and engineering in general, I've realized that developers are the doers of progress. I'm proud to be an aspiring developer and Iâ€™m looking forward to joining a community of empowered agents of disruption. 

> I started to learn web dev for selfish reasons, but as I've learned, the best web devs are sometimes the most altruistic people alive.
