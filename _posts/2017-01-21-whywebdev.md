title: My Biggest Challenge
---

I recently came across the book, [Think Like a Programmer](https://www.nostarch.com/thinklikeaprogrammer), by Anton V. Spraul. It got me thinking, that's where the learning curve is fo me.
I've always been one to learn concepts relatively fast, but with programming, the difference is not **knowing** concepts, but my using them to _build_ interconnected programs. And to
build those programs, you have to consider how they interact, and how they can be most efficiently built. This is where problem solving comes in. 

Problem solving is tough, in every industry, in every era. But, in programming it seems to be more of a challenge because of the syntax. The syntax is not human language, but instead
computer language, _aka code_. Essentially, this is the tough part, knowing the syntax well enough solve those complex problems that permit to programs to run. 

But, syntax can be researched rather easily. For example, a colleague at Bloc, introduced me to [http://devdocs.io/](http://devdocs.io/), a searchable syntax and concept database. But, of course
there's not searchable database for those complex problems we as programmers are trying to solve. The key challenge in addition to not fully understanding the syntax, is the actual
deconstruction of the problem. 

A few solutions I'm currently experimenting with are :

* Pseudo-code for what functions should be doing
* White boarding the solution with colleagues
* Reading code that's been written with similar functionality
* Being very patient!

I know I'll get the hang of syntax, problem solving one day, but until then, I'll persist with sheer will. One day, I'll get to elegant solutions, but for now, I'm grateful that I have the tools to get the solution!
