title: My Experience at Bloc  [so far]
---
So far, so good. My mentors have been very helpful. The team at the top seems to care. I can't complain. 

The curriculum is project oriented. Meaning that after af few foundational videos and exercises, I've had to dive into the world of programming without floaties. 
Starting with just an overview of concepts, and a few exercises, I built my first web app - Blocjams.

While building the app, I realized a few key things about programming and Bloc. One off, the mentors are really good. I've had three to date, 
and they've also had different teaching styles. But, they've all been effective. To me, Bloc is finding the creme de la creme from a skill perspective,
and diversifying for personality. Hence, unless your a sociopath, you'll gel with one of your first mentors. Through bloc I've learned that developers 
come from various backgrounds, and there's no specific "type" of programmer. All have different interests, but all have a love for building cool things.

The mentors are great, but they're only their when you really need support. Most of the learning happens alone. And fortunately, Bloc has figured
that out as well. It's checkpoints are long enough to learn a new concept, but also short enough to allow you to progress at relatively rapid pace.
They walk you through a concept, have you implement it in your text editor, upload that addition to git, and rinse and repeat until the key concepts learned, while the critical ones are earned.

Have a few months to go, but Bloc has been good to me. It's teaching me how to solve problems with patience and persistence. As some might say,
it's changing the way I think about things.
